        <h2>My Mission</h2>
        <p>Artificial Intelligence is a huge buzz word these days. 
            In fact, when I interned at the Wright Patterson Air Force Research Lab, last summer, people would cheer every time AI was mentioned, even if they had no clue what it did. 
            In high school, I was curious about the possibilities of AI. I took courses from Coursera, Kaggle, and Udemy to learn more. I learnt how to manipulate large sets of data using Scikit-learn.
             However, I was discouraged because most of my algorithms had no real-world applications. </p>
        <p>Back in high school, I also volunteered over 200 hours at the Atrium Medical Hospital. From this experience, I got to interact with patients and families in some of their darkest hours. 
            These experiences piqued my interest in the applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine. Currently, AI medical software is used in the Emergency Room for mammography interpretation and trying to detect head bleeds or pulmonary emboli.
             However, the current software produces vague results and is finicky. A degree in Computer Science would help me gain the required technical skills to <b>work on AI medical software </b> to improve patient care and hospital efficiency. </p>
